FirePick
========

FirePick Delta is a rotary delta Pick and Place (PnP) machine architecture 
designed to be cheaply manufactured for low volume and/or DIY use. 
Rotary delta machines are reknown for their ability to place parts accurately and quickly.
Rotary delta machines are also typically
manufactured with highly accurate metal machining processes. Advances in 3D printing
have actually made it possible to build a rotary delta machine out of PLA for as little as $700
in a DIY scenario. Such a plastic machine would not be as fast as top-of-line commercial
deltas, but it has potential. Neil Jansen introduced the first FirePick Delta prototype for
the 2014 Hackaday contest. Since then the designs (and there are multiple) have grown and changed.

Here's a Dec/2015 video of FirePick Delta: https://youtu.be/oeQE3WurXmE

There are multiple versions of FirePick Delta.
